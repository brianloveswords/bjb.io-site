On June 6th, something like 6 million LinkedIn passwords were leaked. At
the very least they weren't storing them in plaintext, but they also
didn't use a particularly great hashing algorithm (SHA1) and they didn't
use any salts, much less a per-user salt. Anyway,
[you can read more about that other places](http://shiflett.org/blog/2012/jun/leakedin),
this post is about having fun guessing some of the leaked passwords.

I used the
[LinkedIn compromised password checker](https://lastpass.com/linkedin/)
from LastPass for this testing rather than the
[leakedin](http://leakedin.org/) because being all ajaxy and web 2.0 it
was much faster to test a lot of passwords in a row.

This is not comprehensive in any category (I just messed around until I
got bored) and this isn't meant to prove anything; we already know that
people use really bad (or in some cases, awesome) passwords.
