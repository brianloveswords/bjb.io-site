Uses jekyll. Clone this fucker, check it out on your server, run `webhook.js -p 9999` or whatever other port (probably good to run in a screen session), set up a Post-Recieve URL service hook pointing to the webhook server. Whenever you push updates to `master`, they will automatically get deployed.
